# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This project is a full-stack web application built with Laravel. The goal is to create a robust and scalable application by leveraging Laravel's powerful features for routing, data handling, and backend logic.

## Style, Design, and Features

The application will feature a modern and intuitive user interface based on the CoreUI component library.

### Initial Setup

*   **Framework**: Laravel
*   **UI Framework**: CoreUI
*   **Frontend Build Tool**: Vite

## Current Task: Integrate CoreUI

### Plan

1.  **Install CoreUI**: Add the CoreUI library to the project using npm.
2.  **Configure Vite**: Update `vite.config.js` to include CoreUI's CSS and JavaScript assets in the application's build process.
3.  **Update Blade View**: Modify the main welcome view (`welcome.blade.php`) to use a basic CoreUI layout.
4.  **Import CoreUI Assets**: Import CoreUI's styles and scripts in the main `app.css` and `app.js` files.
